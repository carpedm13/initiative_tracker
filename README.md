# Encounter Tracker

Encounter tracker is a PowerShell based dashboard to help track D20 based encounters

# Information

This project initially came about after running some combat heavy one-shots as a support/healer. Finding some options online, they were good but didn't provide exactly what I was hoping for. This is my attempt at bringing something out.

This is initially being written in PowerShell, using PowerShell Universal to perform most of the heavy lifting. As I get more comfortable, I will likely move this more towards javascript. As this is a mostly front-end page, there's really not a lot happening behind the scenes
